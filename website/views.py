#A Blueprint simply allows you to create seperate files from the standard app.py

#see this video for explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjVhrIJFUEs
#To use a Blueprint you have to import Blueprint from flask (see above)
#You then assign that blueprint to a variable and then use that 
#as the @route in this code (see lines 13 and 14)

    # you are logged in, is an object containing the users record
    # we can then inside home.html use jinja to access the users fields
    #e.g. id, username, email {{ current_user.username }}
    return render_template("home.html", user=current_user)
